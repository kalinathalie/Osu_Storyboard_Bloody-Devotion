1
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:34,925
Dozing in a silkern night

2
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,624
Melted into a bonfire

3
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,062
The moon of the 16th night

4
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:48,076
Prayers, mercy, compassion

5
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,774
They wonâ€™t be granted tonight

6
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,620
The clown of sleepless nights

7
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:56,911
With a face hidden behind a white mask

8
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:58,965
Is posing a question

9
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:07,390
Of my bloody devotion

10
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,472
He seems to make fun
