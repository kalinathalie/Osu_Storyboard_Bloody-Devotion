00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,637
Scarlet tears stream down my cheek.

2
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:36,979
Time is moving.

3
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,500
I discard everything

4
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:45,095
and sacrifice my soul.

00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:49,308

6
00:03:50,952 -->  00:03:57,938
The moon is high in the sky

7
00:03:58,349 -->  00:04:02,458
as I stand in your way.

8
00:04:04,102 -->  00:04:11,397
Shall we dance in this distorted dark?

9
00:04:11,500 -->  00:04:15,609
